# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction

## About
This project focuses on predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning regression techniques.  
A regression model was built using **Python and Pandas** to estimate AQI levels based on key air pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃**.  

The workflow includes data cleaning, handling missing values, feature encoding, model training, and performance comparison across **Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression** models. Visualizations and insights are generated to support improved air quality monitoring and decision-making.

## Problem Context & Motivation
Air pollution is a growing concern in India, with increasing impacts on public health, including:
- Respiratory irritation  
- Chronic coughing  
- Asthma and other pollution-related diseases  

This project analyzes AQI using daily pollutant concentration data collected from air quality monitoring stations across multiple Indian cities.  
Pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃** originate mainly from:
- Vehicular emissions  
- Industrial activities  
- Fuel combustion  
- Natural events  

The model also maps AQI values into categories such as:
**Good, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe**, making the results easier to interpret and act upon.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to **predict AQI values** using pollutant concentration data and location-based metadata.  
By leveraging **regularized linear models (Ridge and Lasso Regression)**, the project delivers:
- Interpretable predictions  
- Stable model performance  
- Actionable insights for environmental monitoring, public health alerts, and urban planning

## Model Performance

| Metric | Linear Regression | Lasso (α = 0.1) | Ridge (α = 0.1) |
|------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| R² Score | 0.7962 | 0.7969 | 0.7966 |
| Train R² | 0.7967 | 0.7965 | 0.7966 |
| Test R² | 0.7962 | 0.7970 | 0.7966 |
| Generalization Gap | 0.0004 | 0.0004 | 0.0000 |

🔹 **Best Model:** Ridge Regression  
🔹 **Best R² Score:** 0.7978 (α = 0.01 after tuning)

---

## Insights & Interpretation
- The model generalizes well across training and testing datasets  
- Very low bias and variance → **No underfitting or overfitting**  
- Ridge Regression provides the most stable and accurate predictions  
- Label Encoding proved sufficient due to low cardinality in categorical variables

## Language and Library Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how regression-based machine learning models can effectively predict AQI using pollutant data.  
The insights generated can help policymakers and environmental agencies take proactive steps toward improving air quality and public health.
